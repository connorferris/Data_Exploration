# Data_Exploration
 In this I will explore 4 different surveys taken by CCM students in computing classes. The first two surveys being surveys from the Fall 2020 and 2021 Computing Entry Course. The other two surveys are from the Fall 2020 and 2021 Computing Literacy Course.  The goal being to learn more about that data and learn some demographics about the students who were surveyed.  Ultimatelty some conclusions will be drawn as to why students are taking computer science classes or reasons to why they are not.
